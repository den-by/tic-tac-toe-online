   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Execute the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm run all:init
   ```

   *Note: If you can't use pnpm, use `npm i && npm run init` in each folder.*

4. **Set Up the Backend Environment**:

   Navigate to the backend folder and create a `.env` file from the template:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Set Up the Frontend Environment**:

   Navigate to the frontend folder and create a `.env` file from the template:
